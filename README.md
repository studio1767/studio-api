# Studio 1767 - Skeleton API Server

This project provides a skeleton API server using gRPC and mTLS for authentication.

The certificate subject common name is expected to be an email address that can be used to look
up additional information about the user in LDAP such as group membership for authorization.

Additionally, group membership is within the certificate itself and these groups will be checked
for authorization before any LDAP lookup.

Note - the authorization code is not implemented as yet. Coming soon.


## Quickstart

The test/build-aws directory uses terraform and ansible to build the necessary test environment
in AWS to run the server. It create a mariadb server and an OpenLDAP server in AWS, secured with
TLS and creates the configs needed to run the API server and client locally on your test machine.

All necessary certificates are created to secure the services and for users.

### AWS Infrastructure

Use terraform to create the VPC, subnets and servers:

    cd test/build-aws
    terraform init
    terraform apply

Verify the servers are ready for configuring by logging into one of them:

    ssh -F local/ssh.cfg db

Once that works and the server hostname is `s1767-db`, they are ready to be configured:

    ./local/ansible/run-ansible.sh


### API Server

Build the API server with the following:

    cd cmd/server
    go build

To run the server, use the configuration created when the AWS infrastructure was created:

    ./server ../../test/build-aws/local/configs/server.yaml

Once it is ready it prings out the address and port it is listening on.


### API Client

There is a very simple API test client in test/client. It exercises the basics of the API - creating
and retrieving the projects.

Build the virtual environment and install packages:

    cd test/client
    python3 -m venv pyenv
    source pyenv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the client:

    ./client.py ../build-aws/local/configs/client.yaml

You can verify that TLS is working by using the bad client configurations. There are three of these
and are a combination of using a different CA certificate to the server and/or client certificates
generated by a different certificate authority.

    ./client.py ../build-aws/local/configs/bad-client-1.yaml


### Verifying

You can verify that entries are getting into the database by going directly to the DB server.

Log into the db server:

    cd test/build-aws
    ssh -F local/ssh.cfg db

Start the db cli:

    sudo -s
    cd /usr/local/admin/bin
    ./mariadb.sh

Read the contents of the projects table:

    use s1767;
    select * from project;

This should print out the projects that were created when running the client.py script.


## OpenSSL Commands

To decode a certificate:

    openssl x509 -noout -text -in <cert-file>
