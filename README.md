# Studio 1767 - Skeleton API Server

This project provides a skeleton API server using the Studio1767 IDP server for authentication.

It's used by the Studio1767 [Platform 101](https://github.com/parlaynu/studio1767-platform101) project 
as the demonstration API server, but could also be used as a development starting point for a more 
complete studio API.

To see how it's used, take a look at the Studio1767 [Platform 101](https://github.com/parlaynu/studio1767-platform101)
project.
